To get started, download the repository and make sure you at least Python 3.8 or above installed. Afterwards, do `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal in the folder with this repository (make sure it is extracted).
Finally, after everything is installed, run `python3 create_db.py` to create your database instance and then finally finally you can run the web application by doing `python3 run.py` and going to http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

Have fun.
